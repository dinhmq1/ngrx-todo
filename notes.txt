Rather than group by type of code, e.g. placing all reducers in
one directory, actions in another and so on. Instead we should group
by feature to co-locate code that works together, since it's likely
that this code also changes together.

src
`-- app
    `-- store
        |-- index.ts
        `-- todo
            |-- todo.actions.ts
            |-- todo.reducer.ts
            `-- todo.state.ts

Inside todo.actions.ts export individual actions then we can import
them directly in our components.

import { create } from "../../store/todo/actions";

...alternatively we can use a named import to prevent collisions:

import * as TodoActions from "../../store/todo/actions";

The model for a state slice may be defined in an interface inside
the corresponding .state.ts file. Also we'll want to export an initial
state that implements the interface from there. Here's todo.state.ts

// todo.state.ts
export interface TodoActions {}

export const initialState: TodoState = {}

Reducers files like todo.reducer.ts should always export a single
reducer function, preferably prefixed with the state propert it's meant for:

// todo.reducer.ts
import { createReducer } from "@ngrx/store";
import { initialState } from "./todo.state";

export const todoReducer = createReducer(initialState);

Then everything is wired together inside index.ts by defining a type for
the root state and exporting a reducer mapping:

// index.ts
import { ActionReducerMap } from "@ngrx/store";
import { todoReducer } from "./todo.reducer";
import { TodoState } from "./todo.state";
export interface RootState {
  todo: TodoState;
}
export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<RootState> = {
  todo: todosReducer,
};

Lastly, we'll register the reducer mapping through StoreModule.forRoot()
in the app module, we can inject the store. I'm doing this in a parent
component for the todo app while using RootState as its generic type
parameter:

// todos.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { RootState } from "../../store/root";
import { Store } from "@ngrx/store";

@Component({
  selector: "app-todos",
  templateUrl: "./todos.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./todos.component.scss"],
})
export class TodosComponent {
  constructor(private store: Store<RootState>) {}
}
